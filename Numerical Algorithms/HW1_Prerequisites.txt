Prerequisites for the HW1 programming exercise:

Prerequisites:
  Basics:
		- No global variables allowed.
		(- Produce separate routines (i.\,e., for Part I: preparation of the input matrices, $LU$ decomposition). Write modular code! Use consistent interfaces for your routines.)
		- Pay attention to the interface definitions (i.e., use the specified terms! In/output parameters must be in the specified order!)
		- Do not plot results in predefined functions! Plot results only in scripts or self defined routines.
		
	Submission:		
		- Upload a single a_<matriculation number>.zip archive with all your source code files and your report (as a single
			PDF file named 'report.pdf' with all plots and discussions of results) on the course page in Moodle.
		- Subdirectories are not allowed.
		
		- a complete submission should include the following files:

		|- report.pdf
		|- accuracy.m
		|- linSolve.m
		|- part1.m
		|- part2.m
		|- part3.m
		|- plu.m
		|- solveL.m
		|- solveU.m
		... (other files)
		
		
		
		\item Write a routine $linSolveAcc.m$ of the following form:
			\begin{align*}
				\texttt{[r, f] = linSolveAcc(M, b, n, tx)}
			\end{align*}		       
		This routine takes in the same parameters as $linSolve.m$ and additionally the true solution $tx$. It incorporates the $linSolve.m$ and $accuracy.m$ routines in order to compute and return the relative residual $r$ and the forward error $f$.
